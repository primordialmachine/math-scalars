\section{Integration of Primordial Machine's Arithmetic Functors   library}

\subsection{Binary Functors}
\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}    specializations of the
the functors
\texttt{binary\_plus\_functor},
\texttt{binary\_minus\_functor},
\texttt{binary\_star\_functor}, and
\texttt{binary\_slash\_functor}
where the left operand \texttt{a} and right operand \texttt{b} are floating point
types \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.\newline

\texttt{binary\_plus\_functor} computes the sum \texttt{a + b},
\texttt{binary\_minus\_functor} computes the difference \texttt{a - b},
\texttt{binary\_star\_functor} computes the product \texttt{a * b},
\texttt{binary\_slash\_functor} computes the quotient \texttt{a / b}.\newline

The result type \texttt{R} is \texttt{common\_type\textlangle A, B\textrangle}.
The \texttt{operator()} of these specializations are \texttt{noexcept}.

\subsection{Unary Functors}
\noindent{}This library provides \textit{UnaryFunctor}    specializations of the
the functors
\texttt{unary\_plus\_functor},
\texttt{unary\_minus\_functor}, and
\texttt{square\_root\_functor}.
where the operand \texttt{a} is a floating point type \texttt{A}.\newline

\texttt{unary\_plus\_functor} computes the affirmation \texttt{+a},
\texttt{unary\_minus\_functor} computes the negation \texttt{-a}, and
\texttt{square\_root\_functor} computes the square root $\sqrt[2]{\texttt{a}}$\newline

The result type \texttt{R} is \texttt{A}.
The \texttt{operator()} of these specializations are \texttt{noexcept}.

\subsection{Compound Binary Functors}
\noindent{}This library provides \textit{CompoundAssignmentFunctor}    specializations of the
the functors
\texttt{plus\_assignment\_functor},
\texttt{minus\_assignment\_functor},
\texttt{star\_assignment\_functor}, and
\texttt{slash\_assignment\_functor}
where the left operand \texttt{a} and right operand \texttt{b} are floating point
types \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.\newline

\texttt{binary\_plus\_functor} computes the sum \texttt{a + b} and assigns the result to \texttt{a},
\texttt{binary\_minus\_functor} computes the difference \texttt{a - b} and assigns the result to \texttt{a},
\texttt{binary\_star\_functor} computes the product \texttt{a * b} and assigns the result to \texttt{a},
\texttt{binary\_slash\_functor} computes the quotient \texttt{a / b} and assigns the result to \texttt{a}.\newline

The result type \texttt{R} is \texttt{common\_type\textlangle A, B\textrangle}.
The \texttt{operator()} of these specializations are \texttt{noexcept}.
