\section{Integration of Primordial Machine's Relational Functors library}

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}    specializations of the
the functors
\texttt{equal\_to\_functor},
\texttt{not\_equal\_to\_functor},
\texttt{lower\_than\_functor},
\texttt{lower\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_functor},
\texttt{greater\_than\_functor}, and
\texttt{greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_functor}.
where the left operand \texttt{a} and right operand \texttt{b} are floating point
types \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.\newline

\texttt{equal\_to\_functor} computes the equal relation \texttt{a == b},
\texttt{not\_equal\_to\_functor} computes the not equal relation \texttt{a != b},
\texttt{lower\_than\_functor} computes the lower than relation \texttt{a < b},
\texttt{lower\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_functor} computes the lower than or equal to relation \texttt{a <= b},
\texttt{greater\_than\_functor} computes the lower than relation \texttt{a > b}, and
\texttt{greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_functor} computes the lower than or equal to relation \texttt{a >= b}.\newline

The result type \texttt{R} is \texttt{bool}.
The \texttt{operator()} of these specializations are \texttt{noexcept}.
